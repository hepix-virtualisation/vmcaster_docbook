    <title>Deployment</title>
    <para>It is wise to deploy an "image list subscriber" so you can check for errors with 
vmcaster as your "image list" publisher. vmcatcher 
(http://github.com/hepix-virtualisation/vmcatcher) is an "image list subscriber" 
that has almost the same dependencies as vmcatcher.</para>
    <section id="DeploymentSecurityNote">
      <title>Security note</title>
      <para>It is more secure to use "https" than "http" for serving the image list. While 
the authenticity of the image list is secured by the image list signature, the 
signature cannot prevent "man in the middle" presenting an old signed image list.</para>
      <para>For serving images http is as secure as https, as the authenticity of the image 
is secured by the image list's signature, thus the worst a man in the middle 
attack can do with images is provide a denial of service when the image does not 
match the sha512 hash it will be detected and rejected.</para>
      <para>It is expected future versions of vmcatcher will issue a warning when 
subscribing to and retrieving image lists from unauthenticated hosts. Image list 
subscribers will prefer not to see these warnings, and may decide to only trust
image lists hosted on authenticated servers.</para>
