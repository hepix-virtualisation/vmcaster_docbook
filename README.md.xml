    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Vmcaster is a simple tool for managing and updating your published 
virtual machines image lists. Following the HEPiX image list format.</para>    
    <para>vmcaster software is available here:</para>
    <para>https://github.com/hepix-virtualisation/vmcaster</para>
    <para>Users of this application should read "security-related policy requirements for 
the generation and endorsement of trusted virtual machine (VM) images for use on 
the Grid". The URL is shown below.</para>
    <para>https://edms.cern.ch/document/1080777</para>
    <para>This tool is designed to aid "endorsers" as defined in the security policy, 
and anyone who wants to publish virtual machine images in a way where 
tampering will be detected.</para>
    <para>vmcaster was designed with the realisation that users typically create new 
virtual machines images rarely but update them frequently. Vmcaster attempts 
to be the first of a new generation of image list publishers the minimise the 
data entry for updating images, with image lists.</para>
    <para>The tasks of updating an image and uploading a fresh signed image is now just 
two quiet short command line operations away. The aim is to make image and 
image list updates as painless as possible as these are the most common 
tasks.</para>
    <para>Internally the application uses a simple SQL database, SQLite for storing 
image lists and multiple back ends managing uploading of images / images lists 
using a facade pattern. This allows transfer protocol to be derived from the 
meta data of the image list and a configuration file, updates need much less 
effort.</para>
  </section>  
  <section id="Quick Start">
    <title>Quick Start</title>
    <para>Please note this application has online help.</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster --help</para>
    <para>This will always have an up to date list of command line options and state if 
they take parameters.</para>
    <para>vmcaster uses the standard python logging library. To make things simpler the 
vmcaster command line has "--verbose" and "--quiet" command line options which 
respectively makes the logging more or less detailed. You can also specify a 
logging configuration file using "--logcfg". Details of setting up pythons 
logging library and its associated configuration file are out of scope for this 
document.</para>
    <para>vmcaster requires a configuration file, this file should exist in either 
"/etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg" or "~/.vmcaster.cfg". An example template is by 
default installed as "/etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg.template". To get started:</para>
    <para>$ cp /etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg.template ~/.vmcaster.cfg</para>
    <para>When it comes to uploading images and image lists you will need to add to this
file for your own site specific settings.</para>
  </section>  
  <section id="Background">
    <title>Background</title>
    <para>An image list contains an array of images and an array of endorsers. Image lists 
images and endorsers can all have key value pair attributes. Some of these 
attributes are required in every image list. Similarly, endorsers and images have 
a set of required meta data. Every image list must have an endorser, but no 
images are allowed.</para>
    <para>The easiest way to start playing with image list publishing is to copy some one 
else's hard work.</para>
    <para>$ wget https://cernvm.cern.ch/releases/image.list \
        --no-check-certificate --output-document CernVM.list.smime</para>
    <para>This is a large image list from the CernVm project. I provides a lot of images 
in a lot of formats so as many customers as possible benefit from the CernVM 
project. We should now import the image list.</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster \
         --import-imagelist-smime CernVM.list.smime</para>
    <para>To check the image has been imported correctly we can use the command:</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster  --list-imagelist</para>
    <para>To list the endorsers,</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster  --list-endorser</para>
    <para>To list images:</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster  --list-image</para>
    <para>To display the imagelist:</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster \
       --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2 \
       --show-imagelist</para>
    <para>Image list Object's "dc:identifier" is a special property of an image list, this 
is the object identifier and can be used to select items for creation, deletion 
or modification. Each Object has an Identifier, the Endorser object identifier 
is the value corresponding with "hv:dn". Image objects identifier is the same as 
an that of image list "dc:identifier". </para>
    <para>UUIDs are used for the image list "dc:identifier" and also
images "dc:identifier". These UUIDs should be globally unique and consequently 
the UUID should be generated using a UUID generator using suitable seeds. With 
Debian, Redhat and Scientific Linux I use the following UUID generator.</para>

    <para>Object identifiers cannot be modified with vmcaster, they can only be created 
and destroyed,. This is intentional to prevent accidental errors.</para>
    <para>Image lists with clashing  "dc:identifier" value is considered disruptive at 
best and hostile at worst, and it will be noticed by image list subscribers. 
Similarly not having your endorser details correctly is stated in the endorser.</para>
    <para>To change "dc:identifier" this we need to dump the image list to file, change 
the image list UUID, all images we wish to keep.</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster \
        --select-imagelist e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2 \
        --show-imagelist > output.json
    $ OLD_LIST_UUID=e55c1afe-0a62-4d31-a8d7-fb8c825f92a2
    $ NEW_LIST_UUID=`uuidgen`
    $ sed -e "s/${OLD_LIST_UUID}/${NEW_LIST_UUID}/" \
        output.json  > input.json
    $ vmcaster --import-imagelist-json input.json</para>
    <para>It might be easiest to edit the JSON with a conventional text editor. As you 
also want to change many other variables. Note that the new UUID is generated 
using a UUID generator.</para>
    <para>It is recommended that only experienced users with good reason share images 
between  image lists (primarily disk space and as part of automation). For this 
reason while editing the  JSON. So it is probably wise to change all image 
object identifiers ("dc:identifier" for each image.).</para>
    <para>All changes to the original image list can be reverted by re - importing an 
image list previously stored as a JSON file.</para>
    <para>$ vmcaster --import-imagelist-json input.json</para>

  </section>  
  <section id="Configuration file">
    <title>Configuration file</title>
    
    <para>The configuration file for vmcaster is used to define the hosts and parameters 
needed to update images and image lists on the servers publishing the image list.</para>
    <para>The configuration file is expected system wide at "/etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg" 
or per user at "~/.vmcaster.cfg". The image list is in ini/cfg format with all 
values being stored as json. Each section will map to one or more image lists 
and provides the necessary information to "vmcaster" to update and upload image 
lists.</para>
    <para>The following section is taken from my image list management configuration.</para>
    <para>[example.org]
    server = "www.example.org"
    protocol = "scp"
    uriMatch = "https://www.example.org/repos/prod/vmcaster"
    uriReplace = "user_name@www.example.org:/export/example.org/prod/vmcaster"</para>
    <para>This states that all image lists to be published on the server "www.example.org",
should be updated using the "scp" protocol, and that all writes corresponding 
with a prefix of "https://www.example.org/repos/prod/vmcaster" should be updated 
using a prefix of "user_name@www.example.org:/export/example.org/prod/vmcaster". 
The section name is not significant and is just to group the attributes.</para>

      <title>uriMatch and uriReplace</title>
      <para>It should be noted that the external download uri is used to generate upload path that is used.
</para>
      <para>The meta data in the images lists, 'hv:uri' is used to generate the upload
path for the image list. Each image in an imagelist must also has a 'hv:uri',
this is also used to generate the path for uploading images. Processed with 
the 'regular expression' matched by 'uriMatch' and replaced with value of 
the key in 'uriReplace'. The best uriMatch is the most specific, but due 
to the flexibility it offers the user even very generic 'uriMatch' values 
can be used.</para>
      <para>uriMatch = ".*/"</para>
      <para>This is a near universal 'uriMatch' value as it will always leave some part 
of the 'filename' of the External URI in the upload path. Normally I would
recommend including at least the hostname and the shared root path for example:</para>
      <para>uriMatch = "https://www.example.org/repos/imagelist"</para>
      <para>Only in the case of uploading imagelists over the 'egiappdb' should you ever 
use the expression ".*" as this will result in all files being uploaded to 
the same location.</para>

    <title>Deployment</title>
    <para>It is wise to deploy an "image list subscriber" so you can check for errors with 
vmcaster as your "image list" publisher. vmcatcher 
(http://github.com/hepix-virtualisation/vmcatcher) is an "image list subscriber" 
that has almost the same dependencies as vmcatcher.</para>
    <section id="DeploymentSecurityNote">
      <title>Security note</title>
      <para>It is more secure to use "https" than "http" for serving the image list. While 
the authenticity of the image list is secured by the image list signature, the 
signature cannot prevent "man in the middle" presenting an old signed image list.</para>
      <para>For serving images http is as secure as https, as the authenticity of the image 
is secured by the image list's signature, thus the worst a man in the middle 
attack can do with images is provide a denial of service when the image does not 
match the sha512 hash it will be detected and rejected.</para>
      <para>It is expected future versions of vmcatcher will issue a warning when 
subscribing to and retrieving image lists from unauthenticated hosts. Image list 
subscribers will prefer not to see these warnings, and may decide to only trust
image lists hosted on authenticated servers.</para>
