    <title>Configuration file</title>
    
    <para>The configuration file for vmcaster is used to define the hosts and parameters 
needed to update images and image lists on the servers publishing the image list.</para>
    <para>The configuration file is expected system wide at "/etc/vmcaster/vmcaster.cfg" 
or per user at "~/.vmcaster.cfg". The image list is in ini/cfg format with all 
values being stored as json. Each section will map to one or more image lists 
and provides the necessary information to "vmcaster" to update and upload image 
lists.</para>
    <para>The following section is taken from my image list management configuration.</para>
    <programlisting>[example.org]
server = "www.example.org"
protocol = "scp"
uriMatch = "https://www.example.org/repos/prod/vmcaster"
uriReplace = "user_name@www.example.org:/export/example.org/prod/vmcaster"</programlisting>
    <para>This states that all image lists to be published on the server "www.example.org",
should be updated using the "scp" protocol, and that all writes corresponding 
with a prefix of "https://www.example.org/repos/prod/vmcaster" should be updated 
using a prefix of "user_name@www.example.org:/export/example.org/prod/vmcaster". 
The section name is not significant and is just to group the attributes.</para>
    <section id="protocols">
      <title>protocols</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>scp : This is the standard file transfer tool from the openssh project. </listitem>
        <listitem>local : This is when you share a file system with the public server.</listitem>
        <listitem>egiappdb : This is the native protocol for the EGI AppDB. This allows you to use 
vmcaster as a command line tool for updating imagelists.</listitem>
        <listitem>gsidcap : For a long time this was the standard POSIX like write protocol for a file 
storage server called dCache which specialises in storing very large quantities 
of data at the lowest price possible.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>## Protocols : Example 'local'</para>
      <para>example using the local file system:</para>
      <programlisting>[foo]
server = "gridvirt.desy.de"
protocol = "local"
uriMatch = "https://gridvirt.desy.de/"
uriReplace = "/tmp/"</programlisting>
      <para>Note: Publishing an image list without any images is the best way to decommission
an image list when no images are expected to be requested ever again.</para>
      <para>## Protocols : Example 'egiappdb'</para>
      <para>Example publishing to the 'egiappdb'</para>
      
      <programlisting>[appdb-dev]
server = "vmcaster.appdb-dev.marie.hellasgrid.gr"
protocol = "egiappdb"
uriMatch = ".*"
uriReplace = "egiappdb://example_user@vmcaster.appdb-dev.marie.hellasgrid.gr/vmlist/submit/sso/" 

[appdb] 
server = "vmcaster.appdb.egi.eu" 
protocol = "egiappdb" 
uriMatch = ".*" 
uriReplace = "egiappdb://_YOUR_EGI_SSO_USERNAME_@vmcaster.appdb.egi.eu/vmlist/submit/sso/"</programlisting>
      <para>A second example using the local file system:</para>
      <programlisting>[foo]
server = "gridvirt.desy.de"
protocol = "local"
uriMatch = "https://gridvirt.desy.de/"
uriReplace = "/tmp/"</programlisting>
      <para>Note: Publishing an image list without any images is the best way to decommission
an image list when no images are expected to be requested ever again.</para>

    <section id="uriMatch and uriReplace">
      <title>uriMatch and uriReplace</title>
      <para>It should be noted that the external download uri is used to generate upload path that is used.
</para>
      <para>The meta data in the images lists, 'hv:uri' is used to generate the upload
path for the image list. Each image in an imagelist must also has a 'hv:uri',
this is also used to generate the path for uploading images. Processed with 
the 'regular expression' matched by 'uriMatch' and replaced with value of 
the key in 'uriReplace'. The best uriMatch is the most specific, but due 
to the flexibility it offers the user even very generic 'uriMatch' values 
can be used.</para>
      <programlisting>uriMatch = ".*/"</programlisting>
      <para>This is a near universal 'uriMatch' value as it will always leave some part 
of the 'filename' of the External URI in the upload path. Normally I would
recommend including at least the hostname and the shared root path for example:</para>
      <programlisting>uriMatch = "https://www.example.org/repos/imagelist"</programlisting>
      <para>Only in the case of uploading imagelists over the 'egiappdb' should you ever 
use the expression ".*" as this will result in all files being uploaded to 
the same location.</para>
